This is the final project for BYU CS 452
We are working on creating a "Forecast" of different posts of friends, using unsupervised ML through ChatGPT API and create a "forecast" of what your social media feed is "telling you" ie making you feel.

Need to decide:
    *Framework
    *Language - python?
    *Social Media's to scrape 

Initial steps:
1. Data Collection: Gather the posts from the social media feed. You might need to use the APIs provided by the social media platforms. Make sure you follow their terms of service.
    * Added the staring code for Facebook and instagram
2. Preprocessing: Clean the data by removing unnecessary information, correcting misspellings, and standardizing text.
3. Sentiment Analysis: Use a sentiment analysis model to determine the sentiment of each post. This could be a pre-trained model or one you train yourself.
4. Topic Modeling: Use unsupervised machine learning techniques, like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify the main topics in the posts.
5. ChatGPT Integration: Use the ChatGPT API to generate responses based on the sentiment and topics identified. You might need to fine-tune the model on your specific data.
6. Forecasting: Analyze the trends in sentiment and topics over time to create a "forecast" of the social media feed.
7. Visualization: Create a user-friendly interface to display the forecast. This could be a web app or a mobile app.
8. Testing and Evaluation: Test the system to ensure it works as expected. Evaluate its performance and make any necessary adjustments.
9. Deployment: Deploy the system so that it can be used by others.
